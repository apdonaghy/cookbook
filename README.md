# cookbook

 Cookbook was created in the summer quarter of 2020 for the WATS program at Seattle University. It uses firebase to store user data and provides a content management system for users to upload and store recipes and access them from any device. The design is hand-coded and was a blast to create. Hope you enjoy it!
